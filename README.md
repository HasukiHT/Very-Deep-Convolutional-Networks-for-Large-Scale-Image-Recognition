# Very-Deep-Convolutional-Networks-for-Large-Scale-Image-Recognition

This project work is a implementation of [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf) in Pytorch. 
However, the dataset used for this project is a [Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge](https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/). 

### Model Architecture
The model has implemented as per original paper description, which can be seen in the following figure.

### Dataset

The dataset is devided in to 3 sets:

- Train set is composed with 200 clasess and each class has 200 samples with a 64x64 pixels
- Validation has composed with a 50 samples per each class. 
- Testset is a total size 10000 samples.

### Computing resources 
The models were trained on GPU, which is having a configuration of Nvidia-GTX 1070 8gb. Each model has took 14h to 20h for training.
